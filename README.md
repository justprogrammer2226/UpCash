# UpCash
## [For ISD]
UpCash is a program with minimal functionality to account for your income and expenses.

The program meets you with a simple console interface with 5 options:
1) **accounts** - This menu allows you to manage (view, add, delete) your accounts.
2) **transactions** - 
3) **currencies** -
4) **items** - This menu allows you to set your expense and income items for easy viewing of future operations.
5) **exit** - ***I'll let you guess:)***
